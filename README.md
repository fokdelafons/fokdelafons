# Hi, I'm Jacek 🛡️

### Solo Architect & Founder of [Lustra.news](https://lustra.news)

I am a self-taught developer and solo founder building **Digital Public Infrastructure**. My mission is to bridge the "Accessibility Gap" between citizens and the law. I don't believe in petitions; I believe in data-driven transparency.
I don't have a traditional academic background or VC funding. I have a laptop and mission.

## 🛠 What I’m Building
**[Lustra.news](https://lustra.news)**: A civic-tech infrastructure designed to dismantle narrative monopolies. 
I am building a **Mirror Parliament** where legislation is decoded by AI into sterile, verifiable facts, and citizens reclaim their agency through decentralized voting.

## 📜 My Story
Before, I was working cleaning jobs. I taught myself cloud architecture and LLM orchestration. 
I built Lustra MVP from scratch, with zero budget, fueled by the conviction that modern democracy has a design problem that can be updated.

## 🚀 The Journey:
I am not a traditional corporate engineer. I’ve transitioned from copywriting (before AI era) and survival jobs to civic tech development.
I believe that those with the least resources need the best information.

## 💻 Tech Stack:
- **Backend:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Cloud Run, Cloud Functions (Node.js/Python), Firestore.
- **Frontend:** Flutter & Dart (Web & Mobile).
- **AI/ML:** LLM Orchestration, Prompt Engineering (Vertex AI/Gemini), Agentic Pipelines.

## 🛡 Radical Transparency:
- **Source Available:** My core repos are public. I believe in auditability over "black box" governance.
- **Roadmap:** Transitioning to a Non-Profit structure once we establish a Governance Board.
- **Funding:** Bootstrapped. Operating on Google for Startups credits and personal savings.
